"""Fastly JS-challenge barrier detection tests (#586).

Covers the two scraper-side layers of the #586 fix:

Layer 1 — ``scraper.barrier``:
  * prose-only Fastly markers classify as detected via the count-based
    confidence ladder and NEVER take a definitive 0.95 shortcut, and
  * the definitive ``/_fs-ch-`` HTML signature short-circuits straight to
    0.95 fastly (mirroring the captcha-provider short-circuit).

Layer 2 — ``scraper.extract._check_block_page``:
  * the challenge interstitial text matches >=2 BLOCK_PAGE_PATTERNS so it
    scores blocking "fail", while a single generic JS mention stays "warn".

Fixtures live under ``tests/fixtures/html/``:
  F1 = fastly-challenge-full.html       (prose + /_fs-ch- signature)
  F2 = fastly-challenge-prose-only.html (prose markers only)
  N  = tech-article-javascript.html     (negative control)
