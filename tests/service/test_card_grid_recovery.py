"""Regression tests for card-grid extraction yield recovery (issue #587).

The open-neuromorphic.org hardware directory wraps every card's ``<h3>``/
``<p>`` inside its parent ``<a>`` and places the card grid in a SIBLING of
the intro container. readability-lxml scores nothing in the grid (link
density 1.0) and silently drops it, returning intro-only output (~766 chars
from >10KB of HTML). These tests pin the fix:

- Primary: low-yield detection recovers the full body via an uncapped
  full-page conversion (output must exceed the 10,000-char structural cap).
- Secondary: anchor-unwrap preprocessing preserves card hrefs as markdown
  links on the card titles.
- Tertiary: a volume-comparison quality check surfaces a low-yield warning
  on below-floor extractions and stays silent on recovered pages.
- Shared consumers (adapters helper, ``filter_sections``, Tier wiring) all
  benefit from the single shared recovery path.

The deterministic fixture under ``tests/fixtures/html/`` is modeled on a
saved snapshot of the live reproduction URL (same topology: intro container
plus sibling anchor-wrapped card grid, 25 cards, >10KB HTML). The raw
snapshot itself is committed alongside it as ``hardware-page-live.html``
(captured 2026-08-22, sole reference used by the milestone-3 validator) so
mechanical drift between the modeled fixture and the real page can be
checked without re-fetching.
